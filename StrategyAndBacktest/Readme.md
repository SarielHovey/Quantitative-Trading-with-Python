Currently, all strategies and backtests in this folder are based on Uqer platform.
However, as you shall never rely on others in this world, we should build one for private use.
Logics for building strategies can be kept,
but never spend too much time on commands on 3-party platform,
unless your job requires it.

But, if we could make a fortune on ourselves, who in the world will try to get employed?
