# Trend Following Strategy should be used in time > 3 days to capture the trend in mkt
# The strategy should be used when mkt shows obvious trend, NOT when mkt stays around a certain level
# Remember: Futures mks is a gambel table. Usage of Kelly's Fuction is recommended
# In this strategy, we use 2 MA lines, one Short term and one Long term to capture trends
